# Attack Write-ups

This repository contains **practical red team attack write-ups** based on controlled and ethical lab environments.

The focus is not on tools or copy-paste exploitation, but on:
- attacker thinking
- attack chains
- root causes of vulnerabilities
- real-world impact
- defensive mitigation strategies

Each write-up documents how a vulnerability is identified, exploited, and assessed from an attacker’s perspective.
